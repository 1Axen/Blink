# Blink
An IDL compiler written in Luau for ROBLOX buffer networking

## Performance
Blink aims to generate the most performant and bandwidth-efficient code for your specific experience, but what does this mean?  

It means lower bandwidth usage directly resulting in **lower ping\*** experienced by players and secondly, it means **lower CPU usage** compared to more generalized networking solutions.

*\* In comparison to standard ROBLOX networking, this may not always be the case but should never result in increased ping times.*

Benchmarks are available here [here](https://github.com/1Axen/blink/blob/main/benchmark/Benchmarks.md).

## Security
Blink does two things to combat bad actors:
1. Data sent by clients will be **validated** on the receiving side before  reaching any critical game code.
2. As a result of the compression done by Blink it becomes **significantly harder** to snoop on your game's network traffic. Long gone are the days of skids using RemoteSpy to snoop on your game's traffic.
