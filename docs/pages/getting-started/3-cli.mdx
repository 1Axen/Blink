# Command-Line Usage
## Compiling Descriptions
Once you have written your description file (ex. `file-name.blink`), you can compile it like this:

```sh copy
blink file-name
```

This will look for a file `file-name` with an extension `.blink` or `.txt`, in the current directory.
### Watching Description Files
When you're making many rapid changes to a description file or it's imports it can be tedious to constantly have to re-run the build command.<br />
Blink offers a solution in the form of a `--watch` option, when passed the target file and all it's imports (including imports of imports and so on) will be watched for changes,
recompiling automatically when one occurs.
```sh copy
blink file-name --watch
```
